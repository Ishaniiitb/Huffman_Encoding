# High-Throughput Canonical Huffman Encoder (VLSI Architecture)

## ðŸ“„ Summary

This repository summarizes the research work on a **high-throughput VLSI architecture** for **Canonical Huffman encoding**, as published in *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, Vol. 69, No. 1, Jan. 2022*.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

Traditional Huffman encoding requires two full passes over the data to:
- Gather symbol frequencies
- Generate the codeword table

This results in:
- Low encoding speed
- High hardware cost

The proposed design optimizes this by enabling **single-pass encoding** with **parallel hardware stages** for higher throughput and lower latency.

## ðŸš€ Key Contributions

- **Single-pass frequency statistics and sorting** using pipelined architecture
- **Parallel code-size computing and sorting**
- **Optimized code-size limiting** to reduce hardware area and delay
- **High-throughput VLSI architecture** capable of encoding in real-time

## ðŸ›  Architecture Overview

The design consists of three major pipeline stages:

1. **Frequency-Generation Stage**  
   - Performs real-time frequency statistics and sorting using 257 parallel update cells
   - Minimizes latency with pipelined updates

2. **Code-Size Computing & Sorting Stage**  
   - Constructs Huffman tree and calculates code sizes using FSM
   - Integrates sorting in parallel to avoid processing delays

3. **Code-Size-Limiting Stage**  
   - Optimizes canonical code assignment
   - Reduces look-up table size and logic delay
